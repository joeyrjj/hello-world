This is "Hello, world!" from JR.

This GitHub account is for storing my study notes, codes, ideas, etc.

I am a senior undergraduate majoring in physics, about to take a master's in economics at HK this fall. I have learned some programming languages/softwares, including C, C#, SQL, Stata, MATLAB and Python. My recent task is to learn Python to finish my graduate thesis researching on information transition, complex network and statistcal physics, and I would like to take some notes. But I had this feeling that things could easily get really messy in the file system of my laptop, on neither MacOS nor Windows. So I decided to sign up here on GitHub to well organize my notes and all the things created later.

I intend to use this account for a long time. Hope I could persist. (flag

My future study plans are as follows, by priority:
- Python, for web crawling, data mining, statistics and other cool stuff
- LaTeX, for document typesetting, such as papers and notes
- Stata, for economics/metrics research
- R, for data mining, statistics, and maybe other stuff, not sure yet

That is so much for this account and its owner. Thought it might be sufficient for a README.

P.S. Markdown is so comfortable for a typesetting/format OCD like me.
